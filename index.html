                    <h2 class="timmons-font">PASSION</h2>
                    <p>Psychology is something that profoundly fascinates me. I believe human behaviour and its consequences are something 
                        that should be studies since they so deeply influence and shape our way of living and our society.
                        That's why I have a proactive interest in the field and especially in Sociology.
                        This has allowed me to be conscious of multiple biases in our society and
                        make decisions more consciously.

                    <p>I took Yale's Introduction to Psychology course. It gives a brief but still comprehensive description
                        of the most popular fields of psychology and neuroscience.

                    <p>Outside of any formal learning, I studied psychology for hundreds of hours.
                        I specifically read hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, books and listened to masterclasses and conferences
                        of experts in the field to learn.

                    <p>This course explores evidence-based techniques to enhance learning efficiency, covering topics such as focused vs. diffuse thinking, memory retention (chunking, spaced repetition), 
                        and overcoming procrastination. Grounded in neuroscience and cognitive psychology, it provides practical strategies for mastering complex subjects,
                         optimizing study habits, and improving long-term knowledge retention.
                         This course made me more productive and efficient overall.

                        These two courses were the basis of all of my programming experience. I now know about 
                        basic computer science concepts and I am able to code in multiple languages, such as Python and C.

                    <p>I always had an interest in technology but what really helped me actually doing things after the initial CS50P course was Hack Club.
                        The latter is a non-profit organization that helps young programmers all around the world develop things.
                        Me and thousands of others wouldn't be where they are right now without them

                        This course provides exactly that, it is a course where software engineers at Google explain exactly
